    :alt: Latest Version

As the name implies, this package provides utilities related to the detection
of peaks on 1D data. Includes functions to perform baseline estimation,
to find the indexes of the peaks in the data and performing Gaussian fitting or
centroid computation to further increase the resolution of the peak detection.

The documentation is available at http://pythonhosted.org/PeakUtils .

Installation
------------

To install PeakUtils from the source package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

PeakUtils targets Python 3 and depends on numpy, scipy, and optionally on
matplotlib. Should work on Python 2.7 too.
